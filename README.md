# HR Analysis

### Project Overview

The goal was to analyze HR data to uncover insights related to attrition rates, salary, work-life balance, etc. 

### Tools

- MS Excel 
- MySql   
- PowerBi
- Tableau


### Goal:

- Analyze HR data to uncover insights related to attrition, salary, work-life balance, etc.

### Data:

- The raw data came from two separate sources - HR1 and HR2 datasets - which were combined in Excel. Consolidating data from different systems is often necessary for analytics.
- Data cleaning steps like handling duplicates, missing values, formatting issues are crucial. The analysis and insights are only as good as the quality of the underlying data.

### Analysis:

- Power Query was used specifically for data transformations like new calculated columns. Power Query is an excellent ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool for preparing data for analysis.
- Created new columns using Power Query to calculate metrics and KPIs
- Analyzed 6 main KPIs:
  - Attrition rate by department
  - Average salary for specific roles
  - Attrition vs income
  - Average tenure by department
  - Work-life balance by role
  - Attrition vs time since promotion
  - Attrition rate by department - shows Software and R&D have highest turnover
Average salary for male research scientists - provides salary benchmark
Attrition vs monthly income - higher attrition in 50-60K bracket
Average tenure by department - Software has longest average tenure
Work-life balance by role - Sales execs have poorest balance
Attrition vs years since promotion - attrition higher for recent promos
- Generated insights from each KPI related to turnover, compensation, tenure, etc.

### Visualizations:

- Created dashboards in Excel, Tableau and Power BI to present insights
- Focused on visualizing key metrics and findings from the data analysis
  
In summary, the project involved consolidating HR data, cleaning it, performing analysis to uncover insights, and creating dashboards to visualize the findings - with the goal of identifying trends related to turnover, salary, work-life balance, and other HR factors. Power Query, Excel, Tableau and Power BI were used across the data processing, analysis and visualization stages.
